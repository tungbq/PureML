## ⏳ Status

This is an early alpha. The implementation might change between versions without warning. Please use at your own risk and pin to a specific version if you're relying on this for anything important!

## ⏱ Getting started

### 1. Installation

Manage versioning of datasets and models with our python SDK. Versioning is semantic and managed automatically. You can install and run PureML using `pip`.

Getting started is simple:

```bash
pip install pureml
```

<br />

If you are trying to manage versions of dataset all you have to do is use our decorator `@dataset`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from pureml.decorators import dataset

@dataset("petdata:dev")
def load_data(img_folder = "PetImages"):
  image_size = (180, 180)
  batch_size = 16
  train_ds,
  val_ds = tf.keras.utils.img_dataset_from_directory(
      img_folder,
      validation_split=0.2,
      subset="both",
      seed=1337,
      image_size=image_size,
      batch_size=batch_size,
  )
  data_augmentation = keras.Sequential(
   [layers.RandomFlip("horizontal"),
   layers.RandomRotation(0.1),]
  )
  train_ds = train_ds.map(
    lambda img, label: (data_augmentation(img), label),
    num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE,
  )
  train_ds = train_ds.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
  val_ds = val_ds.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
  return train_ds, val_ds
```

<br/>

For managing models we have to use `@model` decorator. We have some other features built in such as data lineage and branching. For more information refer [docs](https://docs.pureml.com).

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications.inception_v3
import InceptionV3
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense,
GlobalAveragePooling2D, Input
from pureml.decorators import model

@model("pet_classifier:dev")
def train_model(train_ds, val_ds):
  input_tensor = Input(shape=(180, 180, 3))
  base_model = InceptionV3(
   input_tensor=input_tensor,
   weights='imagenet',
   include_top=False
  )
  x = base_model.output
  x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
  x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
  predictions = Dense(1, activation='softmax')(x)
  model_inc = Model(
   inputs=base_model.input,
   outputs=predictions
  )
  model_inc.compile(
   optimizer='rmsprop',
   loss='binary_crossentropy',
   metrics=["accuracy"]
  )
  model_inc.fit(
    train_ds,
    epochs=2,
    validation_data=val_ds,
    )
  return model_inc
```

<br/>

### 2. PureML-eval : Testing & Quality Control

#### Step A: Use an existing model for validation

```python
import pureml

pureml.dataset.validation(“petdata:dev:v1”)
```

If you want to add a dataset as validation while saving it, you can use our `@validation`. This helps us capture not just one instance of this dataset but all the future variations without any intervention.

<br/>

#### Step B: Register validation dataset

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from pureml.decorators import dataset, validation

@validation
@dataset("petdata:dev")
def load_data(img_folder = "PetImages"):
  image_size = (180, 180)
  batch_size = 16
  train_ds,
  val_ds = tf.keras.utils.img_dataset_from_directory(
    img_folder,
    validation_split=0.2,
    subset="both",
    seed=1337,
    image_size=image_size,
    batch_size=batch_size,
  )
  data_augmentation = keras.Sequential(
   [
     layers.RandomFlip("horizontal"),
     layers.RandomRotation(0.1),
   ]
  )
  train_ds = train_ds.map(
    lambda img, label: (data_augmentation(img), label),
    num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE,
  )
  train_ds = train_ds.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
  val_ds = val_ds.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
  return train_ds, val_ds
```

<br/>

#### Step C: Predictor for model

We recommend utilizing our base predictor class when developing your model. By doing so, you can leverage the predict function in this class as your model's prediction function, which can be used in various stages such as testing, inference, and dockerization.

```python
from pureml import BasePredictor
import pureml
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class Predictor(BasePredictor):
  model_details = ['pet_classifier:dev:latest']
  input={'type': 'image'},
  output={'type': 'numpy ndarray' }

  def load_models(self):
    self.model = pureml.model.fetch(self.model_details)

  def predict(self, pred_img):
    pred_img = keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(
      pred_img
    )
    pred_img = tf.expand_dims(pred_img, 0)
    predictions = self.model.predict(pred_img)
    predictions = float(predictions[0])

    return predictions
```

<br/>

#### Step D: Evaluating your model is done as follows

Lets see how PureML makes it easier to identify and correct any issues with its review feature and allows you to evaluate the quality of their data and the accuracy of their model.

```python
import pureml

pureml.model.evaluate("pet_classifier:dev:v1", "petdata:dev:v1")
```

### 3. PureML-package

PureML is a versatile tool that allows you to package your machine learning models into a standard, production-ready container. Additionally, you can utilize a user-friendly web interface to demonstrate your machine learning model, making it easily accessible to anyone, from anywhere.

Docker

```python
pureml.docker.create(“pet_classifier:dev:v1”)
```

FastAPI

```python
pureml.fastapi.create(“pet_classifier:dev:v1”)
```

<br/>

### 4. PureML-deploy

PureML gives you the ability to deploy machine learning models without the need for managing infrastructure or servers.

```bash
pureml deploy pet_classifier:dev:v1
```

<br/>

## ⚙ Core concepts

These are the fundamental concepts that PureML uses to operate.

|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model   | Centralized location for users to store their models and manage their lifecycle collaboratively. This makes it easier for stakeholders to manage models and promotes transparency in accessing models for tests, deployment, audit, and other purposes.                       |
| Dataset | Serves as an empty container for storing the elements of the datasets and contains lineage, dataset-related graphs, and dataset files.                                                                                                                                        |
| Log     | Provides the ability to log a range of metadata related to models and datasets. The specific types of metadata that can be logged via the PureML package and how they are represented in the PureML app will depend on the data type and format being used.                   |
| Lineage | Enables the tracking of the data flow from its origin to the end goal, which includes all the intermediate processes and transformations. In the context of PureML, lineage involves capturing the provenance of data and transformations applied to produce a final dataset. |

## 🤝 Why to get involved

Version control is much more common in software than in machine learning. So why isn’t everyone using Git? Git doesn’t work well with machine learning. It can’t handle large files, it can’t handle key/value metadata like metrics, and it can’t record information automatically from inside a training script.

GitHub wasn’t designed with data as a core project component. This along with a number of other differences between AI and more traditional software projects makes GitHub a bad fit for artificial intelligence, contributing to the reproducibility crisis in machine learning.

From manually tracking models to git based versioning systems that do not follow an intuitive versioning mechanism, there is no standardized way to track objects. Using these mechanisms, it is hard enough to track or get your model from a month ago running, let alone of a teammates!

We are trying to build a version control system for machine learning objects. A mechanism that is object dependant and intuitive for users.

Lets build this together. If you have faced this issue or have worked out a similar solution for yourself, please join us to help build a better system for everyone.
